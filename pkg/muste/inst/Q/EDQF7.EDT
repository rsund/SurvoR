To terminate the last field as well               *with <character>, give DELIMITER=<character>,1 .                                *DELIMITER=TAB is the same as DELIMITER=char(9).                                 *If DELIMITER is used, both leading and trailing space characters                *in each field are replaced by a character given by                              *SPACE=<space_character>.

C*For example, STR_SPACE=_ STR_COMMA=; makes the output suitable for             C*plotting it as texts and labels (in GPLOT and PLOT).
