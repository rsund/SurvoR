In addition,   *there is the file type (for example .EDT or .SVO), which is often determined    *automatically. It is a good style to give short names for things. However,      *sometimes longer names may be useful, e.g. when transporting files from         *Survo to other systems like WWW. Within Survo there is no need to apply any     *longer names. Actually it is even recommended that very short names are used,   *for example T1, T2, T3, etc., since more information on the content of the      *files can be represented by comments.                                           *                                                                                *Most file types of Survo allow additional comments to be written freely.        *The most important files are the saved edit fields (.EDT). When saving          *an edit field, write the SAVE command on the first line like this:              SSAVE ART3C / part 3 of the article, practical example (9.1.2002)                *Then, the file name will be "ART3C.EDT", while the rest of the line is saved    *as a part of the content. It will be used by various Survo operations, like     *INDEX, DD, SEARCH, the Menu of Jobs, and the List of References.                *                                                                                *  D = Information on desktop operations                                         %D=DESKTOP?                                                                      *................................................................................*/SCATPLOT?                                                                      @/SCATPLOT <data>                                         / K.Vehkalahti         *creates a scatterplot matrix of active variables in the data set <data>.        *The graphical view consists of ordinary scatter diagrams (see SCAT?)            *which are plotted in their own windows (see GPLOT?).
