This is done by activating /MASTER when the     cursor points to any command which would be normally activated    by pressing ESC. It is profitable to define the call of the       MASTER sucro as a shortcut key (sucro key), e.g. Ctrl-E.                                                                            In this way, working in the 'Master Survo' can be continued imme- diately after Ctrl-E has been pressed. The slave makes itself     a perfect copy of its master and does the job in its own window.  Typical tasks for the Slave Survo are screen graphics applicationsand time-consuming simulations.                                   üL0TVC600@_@@LoLLT=1@CSURVOM@&@CS@;SUR-RESTORETXE@Tp@L0Ta-1@Tÿ KV 2.7.96 (5.10.96 added help) (6.10.96)
