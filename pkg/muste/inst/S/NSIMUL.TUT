The simulated observations will besaved in <new_data_file>. If <new_data_file> already exists, itsprevious structure and contents will be destroyed.   NSIMUL scratches all the text below the active line.   NSIMUL starts by computing means, standard deviations, and corre-lations of <data_file> by CORR. MASK, IND, and CASES specifications(written above the active line) can be used for limiting of the activevariables and observations.   The proper matrix &C of coefficients is computed from the statisticsobtained from DECA by a series of MAT operations.   The <new_data_file> is the created and it will contain the counter-parts of the active variables of <data_file>. All the variables ofof the <new_data_file> are numerical of type 4 and it is initializedwith N empty observations.   The <new_data_file> is then filled by independent standardized nor-mal random values by TRANSFORM. The final simulated values are obtainedas linear combinations (using coefficients &C) by LINCO.TLGEnd@TXStart@SCRATCH €TIA1@2@GOK@@GOK@Do not use the same file for the simulated data!TLGEnd@TXOK@CORR =€MAT &D=MSN.M(*,2)MAT &D=DV(&D)MAT &C=&D*CORR.MMAT &C!=&C*&DMAT SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION OF &C TO &S,&DMAT TRANSFORM &D BY sqrt(X#)MAT &D=DV(&D)MAT &S=&S*&DMAT &S=&S'MAT DIM &SMAT &C=ZER(row&S+1,col&S)MAT RLABELS FROM CORR.M TO &SMAT &C(2,1)=&SMAT &D=MSN.M(*,1)MAT &D=&D'MAT &C(1,1)=&DMAT &C(1,0)="Constant"€SCRATCH €FILE DEL @2€FILE COPY =,@2€FILE STATUS @2€¶FIND FIELDS:€TXA@WTZ4@wTIA4@CEND@@GB@@WNW  4TLGA@TXB@FIND M=€´+;¶CREATE€SCRATCH €.±FILE INIT @2,@3€TRANSFORM @2 BY probit(rnd(0))€LINCO @2,&C€MAT KILL &*€SCRATCH €TIN5@C1@@@GM@A normal sample of @3 observationsTLGN@TXM@A multinormal sample of @5 variables and @3 observationsTXN@has been generated in the data file @2.TXEnd@Tÿ
