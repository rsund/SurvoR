Selected model is the model that remains. - INCL2 includes variables in the model if the t-value > 2 separately for each regressor against the regresand.Stepwise (four procedures): - STEP finds the largest R^2-value from models that have p regressors and then deletes from the model all the variables having t-value < 2 according to backward elimination. Selected model is the model that remains. - STEP2 finds the largest R^2-value from models that have p regressors but deletes from the model each tried variable having t-value < 2. Selected model is the model that remains. - STEP3 does the INCL first and then the DESC. - STEP4 does the INCL2 first and then the DESC.No rules  - ALL calculates all the models. This means that every combination of X's is tried. Note: The maximum number of X's is limited to µsix!STEPREG gathers information into the standard output file.----------------------------------------------------------------------Usage:/STEPREG <data file>,<rule name>,MASK=<model as X's and Y>Example:/STEPREG KUNNAT,STEP,MASK=-----X-XXXXY-X----------------------------------------------------------------------Note: - Do not use following letters in MASK: µx,M,P,R      - Start this sucro with an empty edit field, please.        (do not leave any results of linear regression analysis         programs or other MASK specifications in the edit field.)      - STEPREG uses the space below the sucro call.TXLop@¶¶Tÿ  Sucro for stepwise regression analysis by Mikko Karpoja 1990
