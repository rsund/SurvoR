ISCRATCH €   µµµµµµµHow to make sucros?TW20@All SURVO 84C tutorials have been made as µsucros.TW15@A sucro is a canned SURVO 84C session created in the tutorial mode.TW20@The word 'sucro' has been derived from 'SURVO macro' or 'super macro'.Ta1@µ          Ta-1@TW30@As a concept, 'sucro' is related e.g. to scripts in UNIX,TW5@ but it givesmore possibilitiesTW10@ since all the user actions as well asthe 'cursor choreography', display effects, and time control aredescribed in a 'sucro'.TW20@Although a sucro can be written like a program, the tutorial modegreatly simplifies the work.TW15@This mode permits the user actions (keystrokes) to be saved ina selected file on disk.TW20@Such a sucro file (with default extension .TUT) can be edited laterby TUTLOAD and TUTSAVE operations.TW10@ Then also conditional statementsand prompts for the user can be inserted.TW20@This technique enables various applicationsTW5@ from simple tools and macrosTW5@to large teaching programs and expert applications to be constructedstepwiseTW5@ by using existing SURVO 84C operations and other sucrosas building blocks.TW20@The original form of a sucro is usually created simply by turning onthe tutorial mode (by keys PREFIX T S).TW10@ Then the system prompts theuser to enter the name of the sucro file.TW10@ After receiving the name,the system opens the file and the normal editorial mode is resumed.TW20@However, now all the keystrokes will be saved until the key combination(PREFIX T E) is pressed.TW20@ That implies the sucro file to be closed.TW20@Assume that we have created a sucro file TASK1 in such a way.TW10@TASK1 can be executed immediately as a sucro by the commandTUTOR TASK1TW10@or simply by activating the filename preceded by a slash:/TASK1TW20@Since SURVO 84C does not allow a new sucro to be created in thetutorial mode while using another, we cannot demonstrate the techniquedescribed above by an example.TW20@TL!SUCROS2@Tÿ
