This key, when pressed repeatedly, selects shad-       *ows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,space,1,2,3,... in turn. When text is typed, the current shad-     *ow will be automatically included. When some of the shadows 1-7 is select-           *ed and the space bar is pressed, the current character in the edit field will also   *receive that shadow character. Thus, with the space bar, one can easily paint        *words in the edit field with a selected shadow effect (color).                       *    The selected shadow character always appears as the last character of the        *header line of the edit field. The default character (space) appears as `0'.

Their number in     *one edit field is limited by default to 20, but this number can be changed by        *the REDIM operation. For example REDIM 120,80,50 redimensions the cur-               *rent edit field to have 120 lines, 80 columns (+control column) and up to 50         *shadow lines. If the allowed number of shadow lines is exceeded, an error            *message is displayed and the user is prompted to use REDIM with suitable             *parameters. When the edit field is saved by the SAVE operation, the shadow           *lines are saved with it. Similarly, when loading an edit field by LOAD, the          *shadow lines are loaded as well.                                                     *                                                                                     *Shadow lines are used to achieve desired color combinations and display ef-          *fects, but they also have special tasks in certain operations.
