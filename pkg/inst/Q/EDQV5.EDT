The linear trend is reinserted at the end.                            *<width> gives the "amount of smoothing", specified as the number of             *points over which the data should be smoothened (not necessarily an             *integer). Zero gives no smoothing at all. The results of SMOOTH are             *generally in accord with the notion "draw a smooth curve through these          *scattered points".                                                              *Reference: "Numerical Recipes" (1987) by Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and        *                                                              Vetterling        *  V = More information on transformations                                       *  S = More information on statistical operations                                %V=VAR?
