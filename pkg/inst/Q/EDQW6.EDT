The grouping        *variable may be at nominal scale or it has comparatively few distinct      *values. The purpose of the analysis is to find such classification         *functions that best characterize the differences between the groups.       *These functions, which are linear combinations of the original             *variables, are used for classifying new cases too.                         *                                                                           *The discriminant analysis usually has the following two phases:            *                                                                           *(1) First the classification functions and tests associated with them      *are computed.                                                              *                                                                           *(2) Second the cases of the original or another data are classified        *according to these functions.  @C                                          *The analysis is succesful if few cases of the original data are            *classified into wrong groups. However, we can get optimistic               *results when classification function is used to classify the same          *cases that were used to compute it. This bias may be reduced by            *using cross validation in the classification or another data with          *known groups. The classification may base on the classification            *functions obtained from the discriminant analysis or on the                *original observations.                                                     *                                                                           *The general form of the DISCR operation is the following:                  *                                                                           *    DISCR <data>,L                                                         *    <the definition of the variables in the model>                         *    <options for the printout and methods used>                            *                                                                           *The variables used for forming the classification (discriminant)           *functions may be defined either by the VARIABLES specification or          *they can be pointed by masks X or A. @C                                    *Correspondingly, the grouping variable may be defined by the               *GROUPING specification or by mask G.
