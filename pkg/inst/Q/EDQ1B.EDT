Since for nonnormalized densities the integral has to be                *recomputed whenever any of the parameter values is changed, giving              *a normalized density speeds up the computation. @C                              *As an example on discrete distributions the geometric distribution              *can be defined as follows:                                                      *PROBABILITY Geom(p)                                                             *  Y(X)=if(X>=0)then(p*(1-p)^X)else(0)                                           *                                                                                *In this case the probabilities are correctly scaled, but in general they        *can be rescaled so that their sum is 1 on the range of classification.          *The user is responsible for selecting the range wide enough. @C                 *When referring to a user-defined distribution in the FIT specification          *either form FIT=Beta(3,7)  (parameters given)                                   *         or FIT=Beta       (parameters are to be estimated from the             *                            current grouped data)                               *can be used. In the latter case the parameter estimates are computed            *by ML method using the polytope algorithm (Nelder,Mead 1965) in                 *maximization of the likelihood function (See Walsh: Methods of                  *Optimization, p.81-84).                                                         *The initial estimates may be given by an INIT specification INIT=2,8            *(for example).
