The main module               *is the SURVO MM editor which calls other modules as child processes             *when needed (according to the user's actions). The user has no need to          *know the internal structure of the system.                                      *                                                                                *SURVO MM has been created directly by using the source code of the              *earlier version SURVO 98 as the basis. In typical statistical modules,          *for examples, only slight changes are needed. On the contrary,                  *all routines handling the keyboard, screen and mouse have been rewritten        *using WIN32 functions.                                                          *                                                                                *The current number of SURVO MM modules (EXE files) is about 100.                *Typically one module contains the program code of several SURVO MM commands     *and operations. Furtheremore there are about 700 other system                   *files like sucros (Survo macros), files of the help system, drivers, etc.       *@G A                                                                            *A?                                                                              *                                                                                * S = More information about SURVO MM                                            %S=SURVOMM                                                                       *                                                                                *SAVEMM?                                                                         *SURVO MM allows creating and saving of edit fields up to the capacity           *of the central memory of the computer. For example, in a 128KB memory           *it is possible to maintain edit fields of 500000 lines with 100 or              *more columns. The maximum number of columns is 996 but there is no              *(practical) upper limit for the number of lines.                                *Very large fields are needed only in special applications and temporary         *situations; for example, when irregular text files (created elsewhere)          *should be polished. In general, it is not wise to keep big data sets in         *the edit field.                                                                 *                                                                                *When an edit field does not exceed the capacity of SURVO 84C (about             *60000 bytes), it is saved in SURVO MM (by the SAVE command) exactly             *in the same way as in SURVO 84C.                                                *Large fields with more than 252 columns and/or too many lines are               *saved in a new form where only non-empty lines (with their line                 *numbers and possible shadow lines) are stored. Also trailing blanks             *are omitted and thus much space is spared on the disk.                          *These SURVO MM edit files are in fact simple text files.                        *`Over-sized' edit files cannot be used in SURVO 84C as edit fields              *but they can be treated there as text files (by LOADP and SHOW).                *@C                                                                              SAn over-sized edit field is indicated by a red square   almost at the end       *of the header line.                                                             *                                                                                *As an option (in dealing with certain system files) an over-sized               *edit field can be saved in the old SURVO 84C format by setting                  *string "(84ED)" in the comment of the SAVE command on the first edit line.      *Example:                                                                        *                                                                                *    1 *SAVE BIGTEXT / over-sized field (84ED)                                   *    2 *                                                                         * -----                                                                          * 9999 *                                                                         *10000 * This is the last line!                                                  *                                                                                *This (84ED) option should be never used in standard applications                *since it creates very large files.                                              *@G A                                                                            *                                                                                *S3?                                                                             *Data files have the same structure as in SURVO 84C and 98.                      *Thus all data files (with the .SVO extension) created in SURVO 84C              *are accepted in SURVO MM.                                                       *However, there is one important extension in SURVO MM: In data files            *with very many fields (variables) SURVO MM permits long explanations            *in names of fields.
