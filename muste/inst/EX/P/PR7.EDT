The positions indi-   *cated by `T's will be vertically aligned in the ®nal printout as well and the text   *in the table will be positioned freely to the right of these columns until the       *next `T' or a `(' is encountered on the tab line. In this table, columns `Country'   *and `Urban' will be aligned in this way.                                             *    The other columns enclosed by parentheses will be aligned according to the       *rightmost position indicated by a `)'. In these columns, the text (typically num-    *bers) will be freely positioned to the left.                                         *    By default, each position in the table occupies 60 per cent of the font size.    *This means that, for example, when using the fixed pitch Courier font, the tab       *line has no effect. On variable pitch fonts, 60 per cent of the font size may be     *too much (when numbers and lower case letters are concerned). The user may           *then specify another character width by giving a notation of the type *n in any      *free place on the tab line. n is the desired character width in points. In our       *example, *5 on line 7 implies 5 Points per a position instead of the default         *value of 0.6´9=5.4 Points.                                                           *    An empty T line without any other `T' cancels the effect of a previous tab       *line. One can remove the effect of the tab line for any line temporarily by          *inserting the control character `U'.                                                 *   PRINT on line 2 gives the following table:                                        - [line_spacing(12)]                                                                  (                                                                                     - [SWISS(9)][line_spacing(12)]                                                        *Countries of Northern and Western Europe                                             *                                                                                     T  T  *5           (        ) T     (     ) (    )T                                   *  Country         Population Urban Density Growth                                    *  Finland               4907  66.9      15   0.30                                    *  Denmark               5137  85.9     119   0.14                                    *  Iceland                243  89.6       2   0.91                                    *  Ireland               3484  60.9      50   0.99                                    *  Norway                4150  57.2      13   0.38                                    *  Sweden                8295  89.2      18   0.08                                    *  Great Britain        55757  91.7     228   0.04                                    *  Austria               7463  56.1      89   0.03                                    *  Belgium              10076  73.6     330   0.42                                    *  France               54265  80.4      99   0.34                                    *  Germany, (FRG)       60013  86.1     241  -0.20                                    *  Luxemburg              358  81.8     138   0.01                                    *  Netherlands          14446  76.3     354   0.40                                    *  Switzerland           6284  60.4     152   0.10                                    T                                                                                     )                                                                                     - [M]                                                                                 *                                                                                     *The tables can also be surrounded by rectangular boxes which are defined by          Umarking the opposite corner points.
