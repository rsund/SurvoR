As a        *special case, [trim(0)] discards the fixed line length and subsequent lines will     *be printed without any right edge adjustment. In fact, this is the default setting   *when PRINT is activated.                                                             *    When using a specific line length there is a certain tolerance (defined in       *PS.DEV) for line adjustment. If the line is too short so that the gaps between       *the words would be very wide, no adjustment will take place. Similarly, if the       *line is too long, it will be printed with minimal gaps (typically 70 per cent of a   *normal blank) and the result will be seen as an overlong line. The adjustment        *can also be suspended temporarily for selected lines by putting a `U' in the         *control column. On the other hand, a short line can be extended to a full line       *length by a `V' in the control column.                                               *    The tolerance parameters in automatic typesetting of a line are controlled       *by the code word [END_TOL(u,v)] where u refers to the tolerance in normal            *lines and v to the tolerance in lines ending to a full stop, colon, etc.             *[END_TOL(1,0.3)] is the default setting.                                             -replace ????? 9.7                                                                    (                                                                                     *                                                                                     *9.7 Footnotes                                                                        *Footnotes can be written and placed at the bottom of the current page automa-        *tically as follows:                                                                  *    Indicate in the text the place that refers to the footnote by the character `*'  *with `F' as the shadow character.
