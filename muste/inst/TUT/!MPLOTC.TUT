¶SCRATCH €H.Chernoff (1973) introduced the idea of using cartoon faces as symbolswith data values coded into various facial features.TW10@ The purpose is toemploy the natural capability of the viewers to recognize similaritiesand differencies of the faces thus presented.TW30@TW10@Chernoff's faces are plotted in Survo by activatingGPLOT FOSSILS / TYPE=FACESTW10@followed by a list of variables and their mappings to various featuresof the face.TW10@ A model for such a list is obtained by activatingthe PLOT operation above without a list:TW20@TW10@€TW30@TW20@  The explanations before the VARIABLES line are unessential.TW10@  Let's remove them!TW10@TW10@TW5@TW10@By activating the PLOT operation with this dummy listwe get a series of similar faces:TW20@TW10@€TW20@We can start selecting variables for different features as follows:TW10@To control the curvature of the mouth (smiling) by the variable D1,we simply edit the list by typing D1 on the corresponding lineTW10@TW10@D1TW10@and activate again:TW10@TW10@€TW20@Please, note that the xmin and xmax columns have been automaticallyupdated by the minimum and maximum values of D1 in the current data.TW30@To identify the observations (here different species), we can adda LABEL specification.TW10@ (We also increase the line width.)TW10@º TW10@LABEL=[SMALL],SpeciesTW5@ LINETYPE=[line_width(3)]TW10@TW30@TW10@€TW20@We try now to add more variables in such a way that the human racesappear with human-like faces and the apes get monkey faces:TW20@TW10@D1TW5@TW5@*TW5@TW5@ TW5@(The direction of the mapping is reversed.)TW20@TW10@D2D3D1D1D1* D4D5D6D7D8D2D3TW30@TW10@€TW20@As an option (in screen graphics), the parts of the faces can beendrawn in different colors.TW10@ Moreover, the face and the eyes can bepainted.TW10@ An additional COLORS list after the VARIABLES list givesthese details:TW30@TW30@For example, the mouth will be red (color 2 in the default palette)by addingTW10@ºTW10@2TW10@and activating again:TW20@TW10@€TW20@Coloring may be dependent on the values of a selected variable.TW10@The face can be colored as follows:TW10@TW10@D1 -9:0 -8:2 2:3 7:4TW20@TW10@Now, values of D1 determine the outline of the face:TW10@ For D1<=-9,color 0 (black) is used,TW20@ for -9<D1<=-8 color 2 (red) is used, etc.TW30@TW10@€TW20@The face can also be painted (filled) conditionally with anothercolors as follows:TW20@TW10@F1TW10@F11F7F8TW30@€Similarly, the eys can be drawn in different colors (depending on D3)and painted white (color 1) as follows:TW30@TW10@D3 -1:3F1 0:4F1 2:5F1TW30@TW10@€TW20@The size of the faces can be altered by a FSIZE specification:TW10@9 FSIZE=300TW10@TW10@€TW20@    End of "Chernoff's faces"TW50@0T!1@C2@TL!MPLOT0@Tÿ
