This was the       *original setting in Survo: the OS default path was the same as the system       *path (e.g. C:\E) all the time. Since v.5.00, and the desktop operations         *(see DESKTOP?), this has been changed to allow easier reference to files by     *OS commands without specifying the pathnames, for example. To keep using of     *the system coherent, only either one of DISK and CD can be used. Now CD is      *used instead of DISK in all sucro tools of the system, so its usage is          *strongly recommended. DISK is considered obsolete, but it may be needed in      *some special applications.                                                      *@G EE                                                                           *                                                                                *F4?                                                                             *Another way to select the data path is to press the F4:DISK key as many times   *as needed. A special list of alternatives can be defined by setting system      *parameters 'last_disk' and 'paths'. 'Z' as 'last_disk' implies that the         *selection given by 'paths' should be used when DISK is pressed. For example,    *'paths=C:\MYDATA\,C:\E\D\,D:\DAT2\,A:' . The DISK key can be disabled by        *setting 'last_disk=Z:' with no 'paths' at all.                                  *                                                                                *Without 'last_disk=Z:' the DISK key gives the standard alternatives, say,       *A:, B:, C:\E\D\, D: in turn on the header line. (In this particular case        *the paths are changed by DISK, not by CD as above.)                             *                                                                                *There are plenty of other ways to change paths. For example, the desktop        *operations DD, INDEX and TREE do that. By organizing jobs to dynamic menus      *using the V-sucro, paths are changed automatically by one keystroke.
