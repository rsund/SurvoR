Thisoption is set by a MEDIT_TIME specification.Ta-1@Tp        To continue, press ENTER!@TVC600@_@@Tp@At first a data file is created.TW10@FILE CREATE TESTDATAFIELDS:1 N  2 Height2 N  2 Weight3 S 20 Update     Date and time of last modification (timestamp)ENDTW30@TW10@€TW10@The timestamp variable must be a string variable of 20 bytes at leastsince the date and time of the current update of the observation issaved in the form YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.TW30@Now a setup of one FILE MEDIT page is defined as follows:TW10@After the demo you may study the details.TW10@TW10@MEDIT:STAT SIZE=24,80 PAGES=P1PAGE P1: Case %1/%2          Today is %3.%4.%5 (%6). &%1=$ORDER() %2=$N() %3=$DAY() %4=$MONTH() %5=$YEAR() %6=Weekday Height: ### Weight: ### Statistics                   Height           Weight N             n1: ###          n2: ###S               +++              +++SB Mean       mean1: ###.#     mean2: ###.#S            ++++++           ++++++SB Std.dev. stddev1: ###.#   stddev2: ###.#S          ++++++++         ++++++++SB min         min1: ###        min2: ###S             +++++            +++++SB max         max1: ###        max2: ###S             +++++            +++++SB Correlation coefficient: ##.###                                          %1 / %1=Update% 9 (empty lines)ENDTW20@üTexts with shadows '+' (as n1: and mean1: above) will not be visibleon FILE MEDIT pages.TW10@ They are names of derived fields defined below.TW10@TW10@ün1=$N(Height)                n2=$N(Weight)mean1=$MEAN(Height)          mean2=$MEAN(Weight)stddev1=$STDDEV(Height)      stddev2=$STDDEV(Weight)min1=$MIN(Height)            min2=$MIN(Weight)max1=$MAX(Height)            max2=$MAX(Weight)coefficient=$CORR(Height,Weight)Weekday=$CLASS(day,$WDAY())CLASSIFICATION day1: Monday2: Tueday3: Wednesday4: Thursday5: Friday6: Saturday7: SundayENDTW30@This setup (STAT) is saved as an edit file MEDITF.TW10@LR1TgC1@C1@C!@C1@C1@TW10@SAVE MEDITFTW10@€TW10@Lr1TW10@üAt least one page in FILE MEDIT will be saved in an edit file TEST.TW10@This file is deleted before activating FILE MEDIT.TW10@FILE DEL TEST.EDTTW10@€TW10@MEDIT_SAVE=TEST tells where to save pages (by F11 key or SAVE button).TW20@MEDIT_TIME=Update / Giving variable for the timestampsTW10@Now we are ready to start saving with FILE MEDIT:TW10@FILE MEDIT TESTDATA MEDITF:STAT  / OPTIONS=WSTD2@€üTY20@5@1@The data file is empty.@@ü175üTY20@5@1@After completing the Height field@certain derived fields related to Height are also updated.@The timestamp appear for the first time (on the last line).@@ü73üTY20@5@1@Saving values for the second observation etc.@Please note how statistics are updated.@@ü19087160691778618274158üTY20@5@1@The value of Weight is not available in this case.@Moving to the next observation.@@ü17481üTY20@5@1@Moving backwards four times@@üüTY20@5@1@Making a correction@@ü2üTY20@5@1@Saving the current page@@ü…üTY20@5@1@Exit FILE MEDIT@@ü²TD0@üTW10@One FILE MEDIT page was saved in the TEST edit field.TW10@SHOW TESTTD2@€L1,ENDTD0@TW20@TW30@ü.±TW10@üThe statistics may be checked by CORRMV as follows:TW10@CORRMV TESTDATA,CUR+1 / METHOD=PAIRWISE VARS=Height,WeightTW10@TW10@€üTW10@.±Tp        To continue, press ENTER!@TVC600@_@@Tp@üLoading the contents of TESTDATA into the edit field:FILE LOAD TESTDATA€The timestamps (Update column) tell the time of the lastupdate of each observation.TW20@The timestamp for the third observation is the newest one,TW5@since we stopped by editing this observation.         µThe EndTÿ
